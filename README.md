# DH 140 Project 
## Research question üîç
###### 
I would like to explore the implications of racial disparities behind foundation shades. Key words in my research question will be 'race,' 'bias,' and 'foundation shades.' 
## Importance‚ùóÔ∏è
###### 
As someone with an interest in beauty/cosmetics and who uses foundations on a daily basis, I thought this project could be a meaningful opportunity to educate myself in the problems and biases embedded within one of the most commonly used make up product - foundations. I believe make up is a huge driver for trends and societal perception of beauty, and the lack of creativity in naming darker shades as well as the limited range in foundations shades for PoC reflect racial bias in the cosmetic and beauty industry. 
## Data sources üìë
###### 
1. https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/foundation-names: This dataset will be my primary data source. It contains data of all the foundations found on Sephora and Ulta's US Website. It includes information such as the brand, product, description, name, and specific label of the shade. 
2. https://pudding.cool/2021/03/foundation-names/: This is an article which utilizes the above data to analyze how the names of foundation shades reveal bias in beauty. I think it will be helpful to reference this article since it includes an in-depth analysis as well as good visualizations of data. 
## Analysis and resulting visualizations for your project üìä
###### 
I plan to use variables such as lightness, brand, and label in order to analyze the range of shades that are offered and categorize it by brands. I plan on using a bar chart for this since brand is a categorical data while lightness a is numerical data. I would also like to incorporate data which manually categorized labels of shades into different categories and conduct an in-depth analysis of labels of shades as well as analyze how they reflect the biased societal beauty standards in relation to race. 
## A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research
#####
Through this project, I would like to conduct an analysis of a variety of foundations due to their inherent representations of various skin tones and shades. I hope to gain insights into the effectiveness of the beauty industry's efforts to accurately cater towards a more diverse customer base. Despite beauty comapanies' efforts towards inclusion, we are able to notice through articles like "The Naked Truth" that the process creates an additional layer of bias through labeling of products and the order of presentations.
