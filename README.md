## Research question üîç
###### 
I would like to explore the implications of racial disparities behind foundation shades by examining the shade range, numerical labeling system, as well as the categorical labels of shades. 
## Importance
###### 
As someone with an interest in beauty/cosmetics and who uses foundations on a daily basis, I thought this project could be a meaningful opportunity to educate myself in the problems and biases embedded within one of the most commonly used make up product - foundations. I believe make up is a huge driver for trends and societal perception of beauty, and the lack of creativity in naming darker shades as well as the limited range in foundations shades for PoC reflect racial bias in the cosmetic and beauty industry. 
## Datasets 
###### 
1. allCategories.csv: dataset of foundation shades that used a word-based labelling system and their categories. The labels of shades were manually assigned to 16 categories.
2. allNumbers.csv: dataset of foundation products from Sephora and Ulta‚Äôs US websites that use a number-based labelling system. Utilizing all of the number labels from a single product line, they determined whether the numbers were sequential (i.e., there were no repeated numbers) or the same number could be used for multiple shades in the same line. For sequential products, the data shows whether the products were organized from light to dark or dark to light.
3. allShades.csv: dataset of color information from each foundation swatch. Hex values and lightness were extracted from the featured swatches on the website using the jpeg, magick, and imager packages in R.
